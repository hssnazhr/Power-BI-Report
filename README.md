# Superstore Sales Analysis â€“ Power BI

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- I took on this personal project to improve my visualisations skills on Power BI, especially on making interactive dashboards.
- I created these dashboards with skills and knowledge gained upon completing my Microsoft: Power BI Data Analyst Associate Certification back in March 2025. This certification has allowed me to shift from just visualising data to asking the right business questions, designing visuals that support decision-making, and using filter, slicers, and drill-throughs to enhance interactivity.
- This project analyzes retail sales data from a fictional Superstore to uncover trends in revenue, profitability, and customer behavior.
- The goal is to provide actionable recommendations that improve sales strategy and business outcomes.
